# Let d(n) be defined as the sum of proper divisors of n (numbers less than n which divide evenly into n).
# If d(a) = b and d(b) = a, where a â‰  b, then a and b are an amicable pair and each of a and b are called amicable numbers.

# For example, the proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55 and 110; therefore d(220) = 284. The proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71 and 142; so d(284) = 220.

# Evaluate the sum of all the amicable numbers under 10000.

# Solution:

def d(n):
    sum = 0
    for i in range(1, int(n/2 + 1)):
        if n%i == 0:
            sum += i
    return sum
def is_amicable(n):
    dn = d(n)
    x = d(dn)
    if x == n and n != dn:
        return True
    return False

ami_nums = []
for i in range(1, 10001):
    if is_amicable(i):
        ami_nums.append(i)

print(sum(ami_nums))
